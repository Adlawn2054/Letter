          I know that today is not a Rose Day, but I wanna give this to you because each petals symbilizes my admiration for you. Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth. Like a rose in full bloom, your beauty is enough to captivates my empty heart. The red roses reflect the passion and dedication that burns for you, while the white ones signify the purity and loyalty of our love. In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom. At the beach, as the day turns night, as the sun sinks low, a glowing ball of light in the sky slowly appears. You like to stare at it as it gives you peace in mind, as the dawn's kiss touches your skin, the world pauses as I saw an Angel's smile within. Thank you for being my source of love and inspiration. Our journey together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses, and as warmth as we walk in the at the beach sunset. Happy Rose Day, my love. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
